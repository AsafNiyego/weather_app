weather_app with fun fact
small project with JavaScript and CSS3. 
i used two API's: one for the weather deatils and second for the facts (Wiki). 
once the user triggered the submit button the app will check the weather base on the API and will provide fun details about it in the bottom.
have a sunny day :)
